## INTRODUCTION

In this module, you will learn about another fundamental data type in Spark: the DataFrame. DataFrames were added more recently than RDDs and they make computing on structured data much easier. If you are used to dataframes in R or Python, then you will be off to a good start. You will also see how you can use SQL inside Spark commands. Next, you will get lots of practice working with DataFrames and Spark SQL for data preprocessing and data analysis tasks. Comfort in working with the data will be invaluable for understanding and preparing the data, as well as downstream tasks like modeling. Data scientists spend the majority of their time understanding and preparing the data, so this module is critical.
 
## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Apply DataFrames knowledge in data analysis tasks

- Apply Spark SQL to data analysis tasks

- Differentiate when it is preferable to use RDDs versus DataFrames

- Identify the benefits of columnar data formats like Parquet

- Execute an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset
