## INTRODUCTION

In this module, you will begin by learning about recommender systems and then move to a rich feature utility package in PySpark MLlib. This package supports feature extraction, transformation, and selection. Then you will learn how to construct machine learning pipelines. Finally, you will build your own recommender system on music data.

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Implement recommender systems in PySpark using collaborative filtering.
- Execute the MLlib feature utilities package.
- Construct machine learning pipelines.
- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset.
