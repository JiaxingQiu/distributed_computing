## INTRODUCTION

You will learn a host of Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools for big data computing, storage, and retrieval in this module. We start with an overview of how Amazon EC2 enables cloud computing and how Amazon S3 provides scalable storage. Next, you will learn about AWS Glue for automating ETL, data preprocessing, and data cataloging. We will also study Amazon Athena, which supports big data analytics and SQL queries at scale. Security is job zero at AWS, and we learn about identity access management with IAM roles and policies.
