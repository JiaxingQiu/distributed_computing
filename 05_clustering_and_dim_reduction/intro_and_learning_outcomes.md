## INTRODUCTION

In this module, we will learn machine learning tasks for unlabeled data. We will begin by studying the k-means clustering algorithm. We will use it look for structure in Fidelity mutual funds. Next, we will study dimension reduction. Reducing feature dimension is particularly important with big data, as it lowers overhead such as storage and compute time.

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Implement k-means clustering in MLlib  
- Apply dimension reduction techniques using PySpark
- Distinguish between SVD and PCA techniques
- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset
