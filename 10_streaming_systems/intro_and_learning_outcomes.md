## INTRODUCTION

Stream processing is designed for infinite data, which introduces new challenges. In this module, you will learn about streaming systems, how the framework is different from batch processing, and how to work with the Spark Streaming library. You will then connect to the Twitter API to get a streaming feed of tweets, where you will use your knowledge of Spark Streaming to compute analytics on the Twitter feed.


## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Apply the concepts behind streaming systems.
- Execute the Spark Streaming library.
- Explain the important concepts from Spark Streaming.
- Compute analytics using Spark Streaming.
- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset.
