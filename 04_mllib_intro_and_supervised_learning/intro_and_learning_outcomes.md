## INTRODUCTION

In this module, we will begin by learning about sparse vectors and matrices. Spark uses these objects heavily to reduce processing and storage requirements.
Next, we will begin using the Spark MLlib package for machine learning. Then you will start using MLlib to implement classification and regression models.Â 

Important point about MLlib:
MLlib supports two interfaces for implementing machine learning.

- RDD API - this is the original interface, which is still supported but not under active development
- DataFrame API - this is the newer interface, which is being actively developed
 
## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Apply the basics of the MLlib library in PySpark

- Implement classification models in MLlib

- Implement linear regression models in MLlib

- Understand the benefits of sparse vectors and matrices

- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset
